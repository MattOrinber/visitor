    <span><strong>Paris, Ãle-de-France, France</strong> Â· Member since July 2011</span>
    <p>I love to travel and am always on the go. My apartment is my haven of tranquility in the beautiful city of Paris, where I've lived off and on for 20 years. The 11th arrondissement is a fantastic neighborhood, very vibrant and alive. So much to discover and explore...
    </p>
    <p>
    My favorite pastimes include hiking, snowboarding, eating out, wine tasting, reading, meeting new people and spending time with my friends. My motto in life: "je ne regrette rien!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Enjoy your stay in Paris!</p>

                    <div class="text">I had only 2 days in Seoul and staying at SunÂ´s place was the best idea ever. First night when I arrived Sun, Christy the other flat mate staying at Suns, and myself went out for dinner. Great Food, lots of laughter, discussing sightseeing highlights. SunÂ´s place is super nice, super clean and a 3min walk away from the Underground. Sun gives info to all questions about the City one might have. Was great Sun !! Many thanks
