First night when I arrived Sun, Christy the other flat mate staying at Suns, and myself went out for dinner. Great Food, lots of laughter, discussing sightseeing highlights. SunÂ´s place is super nice, super clean and a 3min walk away from the Underground. Sun gives info to all questions about the City one might have. Was great Sun !! Many thanks
